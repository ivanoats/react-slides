      - What's your "daily driver"? WordPress? Drupal? .NET?
      ---

      # Why React?
      --

      - Fast
      --

      - Flexbile
      --

      - Solid principles from Computer Science
      	- [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) (SRP)
      	- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)">Composition</a>
        - [Reusable components](https://twitter.com/reactjsnpm)
      	- [Immutability](http://reactkungfu.com/2015/08/pros-and-cons-of-using-immutability-with-react-js/)
      	- [Functional Reactive Programming](http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome) (FRP)
      --

      - Small API surface = easy to understand and master

      ---
      # Setup
      - Ideally, you have node and webpack already installed
        - brew (or apt-get) install node, or windows download the installer

      - npm -g install webpack live-server webpack-dev-server

      - But we will use CodePen to start to make it easy!
      ---
      # It's just JavaScript

      ## It's a User Interface library
      Lots of people use React as part of a larger architecture.

      React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.

      # CreateElement
      ```flow
      React.createElement(
        string/ReactClass type,
        [object props],
        [children ...]) -> ReactElement
      ```
      ---
      # JSX is an Abomination....?
      It *looks like* we are going back to the "bad old days" of mixing style and behavior with semantic markup.

      --

      ## JSX is really freakin' awesome and I'm never using anything else
      It actually enables cohesion (clarity) like never before.

      ---
      # Properties
      Use props (this.props) to access parameters passed from the parent.

      - Props flow top-down from parent to children
      --

      - Props can be validated with PropTypes
      ```javascript
      propTypes: {
        name: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      },
      ```
      --

      - Props can be set default in the getDefaultProps method
      --

      - Props can be considered immutable

      ---
      # State
      Use states (this.state) to manage dynamic data.
      --

      - State is internal to the component
      --

      - State is never set directly, use this.setState();
      --

      - Best practice: Isolate your state to certain components
      ---
      # State vs. Props

      - Don't store computed values in state
      - When possible consider props the source of truth

      ---
      # Component Lifecycle

      - Instantiation
      --

      - getDefaultProps
      --

      - getInitialState
      --

      - componentWillMount
      --

      - render
        - can only access `this.props` and `this.state`
      --

      - componentDidMount
        - you can now access the DOM via `this.findDomNode()` (e.g. jQuery)
      ---
      # Component Lifecycle: Lifetime

      - componentWillReceiveProps
      - shouldComponentUpdate
      - componentWillUpdae
      - componentDidUpdate

      ---
      # Component Lifecycle: Teardown &amp; cleanup

      - componentWillUnmount

      # Flux or Redux?

      Watch the [Flux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=59&v=i__969noyAM) introductory video for a valuable perspective on why you might not want to do MVC.

      However, there were improvements to Flux. A simpler architecture was needed:
      The answer is Redux.
