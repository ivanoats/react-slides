      # Why React?
      - Fast
      - Flexbile
      - Solid principles from Computer Science
      	- [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) (SRP)
      	- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)">Composition</a>
        - [Reusable components](https://twitter.com/reactjsnpm)
      	- [Immutability](http://reactkungfu.com/2015/08/pros-and-cons-of-using-immutability-with-react-js/)
      	- [Functional Reactive Programming](http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome) (FRP)
      - Small API surface = easy to understand and master

      ---
      # Setup
      - Ideally, you have node and webpack already installed
        - brew (or apt-get) install node, or windows download the installer

      - But we will use CodePen to start to make it easy
      ---
      # It's just JavaScript

      ## It's a User Interface library
      Lots of people use React as part of a larger architecture.

      React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.

      # CreateElement
      ```flow
      React.createElement(
        string/ReactClass type,
        [object props],
        [children ...]) -> ReactElement
      ```

      # JSX is an Abomination....?
      It *looks like* we are going back to the "bad old days" of mixing style and behavior with semantic markup.

      ## JSX is really freakin' awesome and I'm never using anything else
      It actually enables cohesion (clarity) like never before.

      # Props
      Use props (this.props) to access parameters passed from the parent.

      ---
      # State
      Use states (this.state) to manage dynamic data.

      ---
      # State vs. Props

      ---
      # Component Lifecycle
      ---
      # React Router
      ---
      # Flux or Redux

      The answer is Redux.
